# YouTube-Video-to-Audio-Convertor-in-Python
This project will help to convert any YouTube video format into an audio format using Python programming language. This project uses a Python library known as "PyTube".  In this project, I have created a Python program that will help to convert any YouTube video into its audio format or we can say that it extracts audio from any YouTube video. This project uses a Python library known as "Pytube". Pytube is very easy to use, lightweight, and the independent library is written in Python language for downloading YouTube Videos. Advantages of this project: 1) This Python program extracts audio from any YouTube video just by entering its URL(Uniform Resource Locator). 2) It is a very small and simple program to extract audio from any YouTube video. 3) This Python program creates a separate audio file in our project folder.
